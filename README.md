# Odin Recipes

This is my first TOP project, aimed to practice my HTML skills by building a simple recipes website using the most common elements:

- **Headers**: Used for each section's title, numbering them accordingly to preserve the document's structure.
- **Paragraphs**: Used for brief descriptions of each recipe.
- **Links**: Used to link the recipes pages together, following best-practices.
- **Images**: Used for aesthetics purposes, choosing the best image format and following best-practices.
- **Lists**: Used to group ingredients and steps in each recipe's page and links in the home page.
